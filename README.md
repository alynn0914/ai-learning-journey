# AI Learning Journey - 8 Week Upskilling Plan

**Goal**: Gain hands-on expertise in AI/LLM fundamentals, RAG, Agentic AI, Prompt Engineering, and Composite AI systems as a lead software developer.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master **RAG** (Retrieval Augmented Generation) patterns
- Build **Agentic AI** systems with tool calling and multi-step reasoning
- Implement **Composite AI** architectures (reasoning + execution models)
- Apply **Prompt Engineering** best practices
- Create **LLM-agnostic** applications (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic)
- Practice **Responsible Use of AI** (RUAI) principles
- Work with **LangChain**, **LlamaIndex**, **Semantic Kernel**, and **LangSmith**

| 2 | LLM-agnostic API | ⬜ Not Started | FastAPI /chat endpoint |
| 3 | RAG Basics | ⬜ Not Started | Document Q&A web app |
| 4 | Chunking Strategies | ⬜ Not Started | Chunking comparison tool |
| 5a | Tool Calling | ⬜ Not Started | Agent with 2 tools |
| 5b | Multi-step Agents | ⬜ Not Started | ReAct agent with RAG + tools |
| 6 | Composite AI | ⬜ Not Started | Multi-model system + LangSmith |
| 7 | Evaluation + RUAI | ⬜ Not Started | Eval suite + RUAI checklist |
| 8 | Capstone | ⬜ Not Started | Full app + pitch deck |

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and setup**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-learning-journey.git
cd ai-learning-journey
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **Configure environment**:
```bash
cp config.example.env .env
# Edit .env with your API keys
```

3. **Start Week 1**:
```bash
cd week1-fundamentals
cat README.md  # Read objectives
python validate_week1.py  # Run when ready to validate
```

## 🧪 Validation System

Each week includes:
- **`README.md`**: Learning objectives, resources, checklist
- **`validate_weekX.py`**: Automated validation tests
- **Reference implementations**: Links to compare your work

Run validation: `python validate_weekX.py`
